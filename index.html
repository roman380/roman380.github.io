  <h1>Codecs for IC Capture 2.5 Software with Support for 12-bit Recording</h1>
</header>

<section>
  <p>IC Capture<sup>1</sup> 2.5 software by The Imaging Source Europe GmbH offers seamless support for their cameras
    equipped with high color depth, such as 10-bit and 12-bit pixel formats.</p>
  <p>The high color depth per channel technology is crucial in video recording as it enhances the camera's ability to
    capture details in scenes with a high contrast of light and shadow. This is especially important in environments
    with challenging lighting
    conditions, such as backlit scenes, brightly lit outdoor areas, or interiors with sharp light variations.</p>
  <p>We offer a specialized codec based on GoPro CineForm<sup>2</sup> technology that enables 12-bit color depth video
    recording while maintaining the high quality and dynamic range of the signals. </p>
  <p>The recorded footage is optimized for compatibility with popular post-processing and editing tools, including
    DaVinci Resolve<sup>3</sup>, ensuring a smooth workflow for professional video editing and enhancement.</p>
