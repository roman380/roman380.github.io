  <p>NVIDIA hardware specific codecs utilize video encoding capabilities available with video adapters. A detailed
    support matrix, which specifies capabilities available with specific models, <a
      href="https://developer.nvidia.com/video-encode-and-decode-gpu-support-matrix-new">is available at NVIDIA
      website</a>.
  </p>

  <p>H.265/HEVC DirectShow Video Encoder backed by NVIDIA GPUs is utilizing support for HEVC Main 10 profile,
    implemented in the hardware. See specifically "HEVC
    10-bit support" column in the matrix link above.</p>

  <p>HEVC (High Efficiency Video Coding), also known as H.265, is a video compression standard that
    significantly improves encoding efficiency compared to its predecessor, H.264/AVC. The Main 10 profile in HEVC
    specifically supports 10-bit color depth, which means that each color channel (red, green, and blue) can represent
    up to 1,024 shades per channel instead of the 256 shades available in standard 8-bit color. This profile is
    particularly important for professional video production, broadcasting, and streaming services that aim to provide
    higher-quality visuals. Many modern TVs, monitors, and streaming platforms support 10-bit HEVC, enhancing the
    viewing experience with more natural and lifelike colors.</p>
