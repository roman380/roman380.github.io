  <h1>Codecs for IC Capture 2.5 Software - NVIDIA Specific</h1>
</header>

<section>
  <p>NVIDIA hardware specific codecs utilize video encoding capabilities available with video adapters. A detailed
    support matrix, which specifies capabilities available with specific models, <a
      href="https://developer.nvidia.com/video-encode-and-decode-gpu-support-matrix-new">is available at NVIDIA
      website</a>.
  </p>

  <p>H.265/HEVC DirectShow Video Encoder powered by NVIDIA GPUs is utilizing support for HEVC Main 10 profile,
    implemented in the hardware. See specifically "HEVC
    10-bit support" column in the matrix link above.</p>

  <p>HEVC (High Efficiency Video Coding), also known as H.265, is a video compression standard that
    significantly improves encoding efficiency compared to its predecessor, H.264/AVC. The Main 10 profile in HEVC
    specifically supports 10-bit color depth, which means that each color channel (red, green, and blue) can represent
    up to 1,024 shades per channel instead of the 256 shades available in standard 8-bit color. This profile is
    particularly important for professional video production, broadcasting, and streaming services that aim to provide
    higher-quality visuals. Many modern TVs, monitors, and streaming platforms support 10-bit HEVC, enhancing the
    viewing experience with more natural and lifelike colors.</p>

  <h2>Known Problems and Limitations</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>NVIDIA video adapter is assumed to be the first video adapter in the system</li>
    <li>The codec is compatible with the NVIDIA driver applied by Windows 11 automatically (version 457.51 at the time
      of writing), however it is recommended to install the latest from NVIDIA website; one way to do this is <a
        href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/software/nvidia-app/">NVIDIA App</a> with the function of driver update </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Questions and Answers</h2>

  <p><b>Q:</b> HEVC AVI files are recognized by some software, but not my favorite application, is there any solution
    for this?
  </p>

  <p><b>A:</b> IC Capture 2.5 creates AVI files, and hence AVI is the output. AVI is an older container format that
    isn't commonly used with HEVC, as it lacks support for modern compression features. While HEVC is practical for
    high-quality video with reduced file sizes, using AVI as a container for HEVC isn't ideal due to compatibility
    issues with media players and devices.</p>

  <p>However, to address this problem this codec creates additional MP4 file with the same content as AVI. When you
    configure IC Capture 2.5 to record video into an AVI file,
    after recording session you will find additional MP4 file with the same name, same content in the target directory.
    You can use it right away instead of the AVI recording.</p>

  <p><b>Q:</b> Is it possible to use the codec with 32-bit version of IC Capture 2.5?</p>

  <p><b>A:</b> No, we do not provide the 32-bit version of the codec. IC Capture 2.5 software is provided in two
    variants in the same installer. Please use 64-bit (x64) build of the application at all times.</p>

  <p><b>Q:</b> Is it possible to use the codec with IC Measure software, or with IC Capture 4?</p>

  <p><b>A:</b> No, not yet. The Imaging Source removed support for AVI recording, for DirectShow recording and reduced
    extensibility surface. We currently have no plans to extend their MP4 recording capabilities.
    However note that with AVI recording in IC Capture 2.5 you immediately get both AVI and MP4 files with the same
    content, so you can MP4 version right away with the applications that require this format.</p>

  <p><b>Q:</b> Is it possible to change frame rate (speed) of the created MP4 recording?</p>

  <p><b>A:</b> For some applications the maximal supported capture rate of specific camera might be insufficient, and a
    solution to this might be slowed down recording. The resulting media file is, hence, recorded at slowed down speed
    as well. There might be multiple ways to address the restoration of the originally intended speed. </p>

  <p>On way is to use available tools like FFmpeg to re-package the video (without re-compression, or with if you want):
    please refer to the documentation of such tooling.</p>

  <p>The codec also provides a convenience helper to update frame rate of already created MP4 recording. To find the
    helper, start IC Capture 2.5 application and go to codec configuration UI. The property sheet contains a "Frame Rate
    Helper" page, which lets you specify a MP4 file and desired frame rate. The helper will then create a new MP4 file
    with the same content, but with the specified frame rate.
