<section>
  <p>NVIDIA hardware specific codecs utilize video encoding capabilities available with video adapters. A detailed
    support matrix, which specifies capabilities available with specific models, <a
      href="https://developer.nvidia.com/video-encode-and-decode-gpu-support-matrix-new">is available at NVIDIA
      website</a>.
  </p>

  <p>H.265/HEVC DirectShow Video Encoder powered by NVIDIA GPUs is utilizing support for HEVC Main 10 profile,
    implemented in the hardware. See specifically "HEVC
    10-bit support" column in the matrix link above.</p>

  <p>HEVC (High Efficiency Video Coding), also known as H.265, is a video compression standard that
    significantly improves encoding efficiency compared to its predecessor, H.264/AVC. The Main 10 profile in HEVC
    specifically supports 10-bit color depth, which means that each color channel (red, green, and blue) can represent
    up to 1,024 shades per channel instead of the 256 shades available in standard 8-bit color. This profile is
    particularly important for professional video production, broadcasting, and streaming services that aim to provide
    higher-quality visuals. Many modern TVs, monitors, and streaming platforms support 10-bit HEVC, enhancing the
    viewing experience with more natural and lifelike colors.</p>

  <h2>Known Problems and Limitations</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>NVIDIA video adapter is assumed to be the first video adapter in the system</li>
    <li>The codec is compatible with the NVIDIA driver applied by Windows 11 automatically (version 457.51 at the time
      of writing), however it is recommended to install the latest from NVIDIA website; one way to do this is <a
        href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/software/nvidia-app/">NVIDIA App</a> with the function of driver update </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Questions and Answers</h2>

  <p><b>Q:</b> HEVC AVI files are recognized by some software, but not my favorite application, is there any solution
    for this?
  </p>

  <p><b>A:</b> IC Capture 2.5 creates AVI files, and hence AVI is the output. AVI is an older container format that
    isn't
    commonly used with HEVC, as it lacks support for modern compression features. While HEVC is practical for
    high-quality video with reduced file sizes, using AVI as a container for HEVC isn't ideal due to compatibility
    issues with media players and devices.</p>

  <p>There are online tools for conversion but most likely the file is huge and so you can convert the files with an
    offline tool. Download <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-windows">FFmpeg</a>, and since AVI file
    already contains HEVC video, you can avoid re-encoding and simply copy the video stream:</p>

  <code>ffmpeg -i input.avi -c:v copy -an output.mp4
  </code>

  <p>This method is fast and preserves quality since it doesn’t re-encode the video.</p>
